A)doesn't mutate the original lists because function creates
variables that only exist locally within the function, not 
mutating the ones outside
one is ["one"]
two is ["two"]
three is ["three"]

B)same as A, the assignments make local variables point to something
but dont change what the outside variables point to
one is ["one"]
two is ["two"]
three is ["three"]

C)the one changes the original values
one is ["two"]
two is ["three"]
three is ["one"]
